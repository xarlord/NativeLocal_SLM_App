# ============================================
# POLICY EXPLANATIONS
# ============================================

# ALLOWED:
# - MIT, Apache 2.0, BSD, ISC: Permissive licenses that allow
#   commercial use, modification, and distribution
# - Minimal restrictions, suitable for proprietary software
# - Safe for most use cases

# RESTRICTED:
# - GPL, AGPL: Strong copyleft licenses that require derivative
#   works to be licensed under the same terms
# - AGPL also requires source disclosure for network use
# - Could force your proprietary code to become open source
# - BLOCKED to protect intellectual property

# REVIEW REQUIRED:
# - LGPL: Lesser GPL - allows linking but requires dynamic linking
#   or source availability for library modifications
# - MPL, EPL: Weak copyleft with file-based requirements
# - May have special requirements for corporate use
# - Legal review needed to ensure proper compliance

# ============================================
# USAGE NOTES
# ============================================

# 1. Adding Licenses:
#    - Use the full SPDX identifier when possible (e.g., "Apache-2.0")
#    - Include common variations for better matching
#    - Reference https://spdx.org/licenses/ for official list
#
# 2. License Conflicts:
#    - Some licenses cannot be combined (e.g., GPL with proprietary)
#    - Consider your project's distribution model
#    - Consult legal counsel for complex cases
#
# 3. Exceptions:
#    - For exceptions to this policy, create a legal review ticket
