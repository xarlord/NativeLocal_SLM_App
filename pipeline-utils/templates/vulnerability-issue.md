## Affected Components

### Where It's Used
```
Check the following locations:
- build.gradle / build.gradle.kts files
- Gradle dependency declarations
- Transitive dependencies
```

### Identification Commands
```bash
# Find where this dependency is used
./gradlew dependencyInsight --dependency {{DEPENDENCY_NAME}}

# Check the dependency tree
./gradlew dependencies
```

---

## Remediation Steps

### 1. Update to a Secure Version
```bash
# Check for available updates
./gradlew dependencyUpdates

# Update the dependency in build.gradle
# Change version to the latest secure version

# Clean and rebuild
./gradlew clean build
```

### 2. Verify the Fix
```bash
# Run tests to ensure compatibility
./gradlew test

# Run security scan again
./gradlew dependencyCheckAnalyze

# Verify the vulnerability is resolved
```

### 3. Deployment
After updating and testing:
1. Create a pull request with the fix
2. Have it reviewed by the security team
3. Deploy to staging environment first
4. Monitor for issues
5. Deploy to production

---

## Immediate Actions (if Critical/High)

### If No Fix Is Available
1. **Workaround:** Implement a code-level workaround if possible
2. **Mitigation:** Add additional security controls
3. **Isolation:** Isolate affected systems
4. **Monitoring:** Increase monitoring for exploitation attempts
5. **Backup:** Prepare rollback plan

### Temporary Mitigation Strategies
- Add input validation and sanitization
- Implement rate limiting
- Add authentication/authorization checks
- Monitor and log suspicious activities
- Update WAF rules if applicable
